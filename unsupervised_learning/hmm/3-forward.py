    N is the number of hidden states
    M is the number of all possible observations
    Transition is a 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (N, N)
        containing the transition probabilities
    Transition[i, j] is the probability of transitioning
        from the hidden state i to j
    Initial a numpy.ndarray of shape (N, 1) containing the
        probability of starting in a particular hidden state
